    <h2>Lata Mangeshkar's <span> Personal Quotes</span></h2>
    <div class="main7">
      <div class="about-text7">
            <p>-About singing for Veer Zaara (2004): "Madan Mohan was like my brother. Yashji's like my brother. I felt I had gone back in time."<br><br>
                -About her love of diamonds: "I've been fond of diamonds from childhood. As a child, my father used to design jewelry. But we couldn't afford them.
                 He had a keen eye for jewelry and was fond of wearing precious stones. We kids were equally fascinated by jewels. But until I became a professional playback singer, I refused to wear jewelry. 
                 I had decided I'd wear only diamonds."<br><br>
                 -About the number of her songs being remixed in music videos: "I don't like it. I don't like remix albums as a concept. On top of that, these girls dancing in itsy-bitsy clothes suggestively! 
                 From childhood we've been told that a woman's dignity is in the way she conducts herself in public. The less you reveal, the more attractive you appear. I must say that the songs that I considered 
                 vulgar in those days seem like bhajans [devotional music] compared with what's being sung these days! Yes, I've sung naughty songs, but "Kaanta Lagaa," for instance, had another context when I sang it.
                  I feel sorry for the girl who was seen in the music video of "Kaanta Lagaa." I've heard she's from a decent family. Why wasn't she stopped by her family? Ambition? If she did it with their consent, then God help them. 
                  I struggled hard to get where I am - that's why I am still here."<br><br>
            </p>
                <p>
                    -About music composition: "It doesn't suit me. Although I've done it in the past, now I don't feel like it. I don't think I've the patience."<br><br>
                    -About the December 2004 tsunami: "This sort of calamity shakes our faith in every law of nature. Little children, women, and entire families have perished. We must help...yes we must."<br><br>
                    -About Michael Jackson: "I never got opportunity to meet him. I'll always have this regret in my heart."<br><br>
